## Cleanup

For efficiency this workflow cached intermediate results. This saves time and
allows you to resume partial runs after interruptions. But if want to recompute
your results you must first delete the cache directory.

```{r eval=dir_exists(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows"))}
user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows") |> dir_tree()

user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows") |> dir_delete()
```

## Cleanup

For efficiency this workflow cached intermediate results. This saves time and
allows you to resume partial runs after interruptions. 

```{r eval=dir_exists(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows"))}
# NOTE: If you run other workflows (as I did), this shows the cache for all
dir_tree(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows"))
```

But if want to recompute your results you must first delete the cache directory
with something like this:

```r
library(fs)
library(rappdirs)

dir_delete(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows/PROFILE-DIRECTORY-YOU-WANT-TO-DELETE"))
```

## Cleanup

Here is the cache that allows you to resume after interruptions. 

* The number of files is determined by `params$chunks`.

```{r eval=dir_exists(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows"))}
# NOTE: If other workflows run before this one, this shows the cache of all
cache_info()
```

If you want to recompute some result, you must first delete the relevant cache:

```r
library(fs)
library(rappdirs)

dir_delete(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows/PROFILE-DIRECTORY-YOU-WANT-TO-DELETE"))

# DANGER: Or delete the entire default cache directory with
cache_delete()
```

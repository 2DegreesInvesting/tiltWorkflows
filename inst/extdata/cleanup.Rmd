## Cleanup

Here is the cache of intermediate results. Any intermediate result won't be
recomputed, so you can resume after interruptions.

```{r eval=dir_exists(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows"))}
# NOTE: If you run other workflows (as I did), this shows the cache for all
dir_tree(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows"))
```

But if do want to recompute some result you must first delete the relevant cache:

```r
library(fs)
library(rappdirs)

dir_delete(user_cache_dir("tiltWorkflows/PROFILE-DIRECTORY-YOU-WANT-TO-DELETE"))
```
